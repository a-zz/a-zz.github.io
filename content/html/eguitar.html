	<h1>How an electric guitar works</h1>

	<p>Electric guitars are my passion; one of them, at least. I love
		their eclectic nature, ranging all the way from sensitive to
		energetic, from cristal clean to horridly noisy, from subtle to loud.
		They're my big frustration too: I've spent years on them, but achieved
		nothing worth. I love music, but I'm terribly bad at it.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I like talking about guitars, hence this article. My
		intention isn't explaining the obvious: that an electric guitar works
		by converting the vibration of a steel-made string into an electric
		signal by electromagnetic induction (the same working principle of
		your bycicle dynamo). My goal is fully different. You often watch a
		guy playing a weathered guitar with a loosy amp and: wow, how could
		possibly this guy get that sound?! That's what I want to talk about.</p>

	<p>And -well- it's mostly wave physics plus taste and musical
		sense. The first can be explained, that's what I'm in. The second is a
		mistery, one may have it or not. But it's the most important
		ingredient, and sadly the one I lack.</p>

	<p>It's worth noting that wave physics also plays a big role in
		acoustic / classical guitars, of course, but its effect is highly
		emphasized in electric guitars by amplification and distortion.</p>

	<p>
		Because -first important lesson here- the instrument of the electric
		guitarist is the combination of guitar <em>and</em> amplifier. Not
		only because an electric guitar is useless without an amp; also
		because a certain guitar and a certain amp defines what the player can
		do. Sound-wise, I mean; playing technique is a fully different matter.
	</p>

	<p>Ok, let's play! I'm starting by purely-acoustic wave physics and
		then moving on to the effect of amplification on it.</p>

	</ol> <a id="section1" name="section1"></a>
	<h2>1. Dynamics</h2>

	<p>
		The most obvious aspect of the sound coming from a string is not
		volume-related. The dynamics, or <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)">acoustic
			envelope</a>, of a plucked string is something like this:
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-adsr-natural"></canvas>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			(charting gently provided by <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a>)
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		You see, there's a sharp initial raise (or <em>attack</em>), no <em>sustain</em>
		and a relatively quick <em>decay</em> that soon gets below your
		hearing threshold causing the string to "stop" ringing (although it
		may keep vibrating for a bit longer). This is quite straightforward to
		get even for people without a fine ear.
	</p>

	<p>Not much more to say about that, except that the acoustic
		envelope is one of the two characteristics that make up for the timbre
		of an instrument, what tells apart a guitar from a flicorno, let's
		say.</p> <a id="section2" name="section2"></a>
	<h2>2. One string vibrating - Harmonics</h2>

	<p>When you pluck a guitar string you intuitively guess that it's
		going to vibrate this way:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natural-1st"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>The resulting tone is directly related to the vibration
		frequency, and that depends of three physycal features of the string:



	
	<ul>
		<li>Length. The longer the basser. Bass guitars are longer than
			-well- regular guitars, i.e. Wave length is in fact the inverse of
			frequency.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Gauge. The heavier the basser. Again, bass guitars have
			heavier strings than guitars.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Tension. The higher the trebler. Within a guitar, strings
			have diminishing gauges to get higher tones while keeping a uniform
			tension; otherwise, treble strings would need higher tension (and
			would be harder to pluck).</li>
		<br />
		<li>(well, vibration frequency also depends on the material
			stiffness, but I'm asuming that guitar-string steel is usually quite
			the same)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Nothing fancy here, but hey: a string can actually vibrate this
		way too:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natural-2nd"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>And this way:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natural-3rd"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>And these (infinite) other ways:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natural-4th"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>
		In physycs these different modes of vibration are called -well- <em>modes
			of vibration</em>, but in musical theory they'are usually called <em>harmonics</em>.
		Four important things to know about them are:
	<ul>
		<li>Harmonic wave lentghs are always related to the furndamental
			(base) tone by simple fractions. In the pictures above you see wave
			lenghts of: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... The related fequencies, and thus the
			sound tones, are the inverse of those: 1, 2, 3, 4.</li>
		<br />
		<li>There're infinite harmonics or increasing frequency, but</li>
		<br />
		<li>As you may see in the pictures above they're diminishing in
			amplitude, and thus sound volume. The fundamental is the louder
			harmonic, and higher ones are progressively quieter.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The most shocking fact: all harmonics are always present when
			a string is vibrating.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Yes, that's right. You need a fine ear to get them, but infinite
		harmonic overtones, with diminishing amplitude, are there whenever you
		pluck a guitar string.</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natural"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>In acoustic guitars, the string vibration propagates through the
		bridge to the guitar top. The top may react differently to different
		frequencies, and therefore some harmonics may be damped or even killed
		altogether. That's what distinguishes a classical guitar from a
		western acoustic, for instance (the later being richer in higher
		harmonics). In fact, harmonic spectrum is the second component of an
		instrument timbre.</p>

	<p>You can also modify slightly the harmonic spectrum by retaining
		the string at certain points with your finger tip, but that's part of
		playing technique and not too relevant for our current discussion.</p>

	<p>To end this section: as you may know, or suspect, harmonics are
		the base of the musical device of harmony. But that's too huge a world
		apart, we won't come into it (today).</p> <a id="section3" name="section3"></a>
	<h2>3. Two (or more) strings vibrating - Wave addition?</h2>

	<p>When you have two random waves together you intuitively guess
		they will add to form a larger wave, but look:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-2strings"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>
		When two peaks or two valleys meet they do add up; but when a peak
		meets a valley, they actually substract. When two random strings are
		plucked together what you got is an irregular, pulsating wave
		unpleasant to you ear. That's what <em>dissonance</em> is.
	</p>

	<p>But it is actually worse. Remember harmonics? When two strings
		are plucked together what you got are two full sets of harmonics
		fighting each other, causing a mess of interfeering waves. Acostic
		chaos!</p>

	<p>You may be thinking that when two strings in a guitar are
		plucked together they usually sound good. Well, you're right, but they
		do only under very restrictive conditions:
	<ul>
		<li>The guitar is properly tuned; and</li>
		<br />
		<li>You finger the right frets to choose two notes that actually
			fit together.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		That right fit is achieved when both notes' fundamental frequencies
		have a simple mathematical relation such as: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3... The
		reason is that, while they still will interfere with each other,
		they'll do in a regular, periodic manner that your ear will easilly
		accept. That's what we call a <em>chord</em>. We're being dragged
		again into the world of harmony, which is precisely the theory of
		chord formation; but still, we won't come into it (today).
	</p>

	<p>Achieving a nice relation between two fundamental notes doesn't
		ensure that all of their harmonics will do. In fact most of the times
		they won't, but you know, higher harmonics have progressively
		diminishing volumes, so the interference they cause is progressively
		less relevant. That's why some kind of chords sound better than
		others; some are smooth and regular (i.e. major chords), some are
		slightly dissonant. You need a very fine ear to pick that; people not
		having it (like myself) can anyway perceive the subjective, distinct
		"mood" of each chord type. And anyway they can definitely learn
		harmony, duh.</p>

	<p>Of course guitar players aren't restricted to two-note chords,
		up to six can be used, but that doesn't change the discussion above
		too much. Sure, the more notes the messier, but when you play
		six-string chords in a guitar you're most of the time playing simple
		5th (three-note) chords with some duplicate notes. That's fine to gain
		volume and presence without extra harmonic complexity. Certain styles
		of music favour 7th and higher chords where a greater amount of
		dissonance is unavoidable; Jazz, for instance (no wonder dissonance is
		an important feature of Jazz music).</p>

	<p>
		A last thing I should mention. What if you have two waves of the same
		frequency and amplitude playing together? If their peaks and valleys
		are "synchronized" they just add up, producing a wave two times the
		amplitude; in wave physics they're said to be <em>in phase</em>. When
		<em>out of phase</em> sometimes they'll add and sometimes they'll
		substract, therefore yielding a wave of the same frequency but with
		less-than-double amplitude.
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-outofphase"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>
		When in <em>anti-phase</em> they will cancel each other altogether.
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-antiphase"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>That can't happen within an acoustic guitar. But it'll be
		relevant later, and now was the right moment to introduce it.</p>

	<p>Ok, time to switch the amp on.</p> <a id="section4" name="section4"></a>
	<h2>4. Electric amplification - Distortion!</h2>

	<p>
		An amp, by definition, takes an electric signal and outputs a higher
		level one. The output / input level ratio is what we call the amp <em>gain</em>.
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-gain"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>
		But every electronic amp has a maximum, or <em>saturation</em>, output
		level which can't be exceeded; when your input level times gain would
		be over the saturation level, what you got is exactly that level.
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-saturation"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>The fine thing about old-school tube amps favoured by guitar
		players is that the transition from gain operation to saturation is
		relatively smooth.</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-tube-saturation"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>If you feed a weak input signal into the amp, it may keep within
		the gain zone. As a result you get a high-fidelity reproduction of
		your signal with higher volume level. It's when you feed a higher
		level signal, or use a higher gain, when the amp starts doing its
		magic.</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-distorted-wave"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>
		You see, your clean sine wave is transformed into a weird shape,
		resulting from softly clipping the original peaks. That's what we call
		<em>distortion</em>, and when it makes its appearance beautiful things
		happen.
	</p>

	<p>Take for instance your acoustic envelope; under distortion the
		string dynamics are transformed into something like this:</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-adsr-natdist"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>You're losing attack, gaining sustain and a longer decay. That
		makes up for the usual long-ringing, flute-like dynamics of a guitar
		solo.</p>

	<p>Maybe even more dramatic is the effect on harmonics. Lower (and
		louder) harmonics may push the amp into saturation, while higher ones
		may still fit within the gain zone. As a result, the fundamental is
		equalized with adjacent harmonics and higher ones get to be more
		prominent, making up for a richer tone with a lot of low-end and
		sparkling top.</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-harmonics-natdist"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>So, you're altering the dynamics and harmonic spectrum of your
		guitar, and therefore its timbre. You can have many different
		instruments just by changing your amp gain!</p>

	<p>What if you pluck two strings simultaneously? Remember that
		harmonic interference will usually lead to a pulsating wave. That's
		barely noticeable in an acoustic guitar, but, as said before,
		distortion clips / equalizes lower harmonics and emphasizes the higher
		ones, making up for a lot of potential interference. As a result a
		chord in an electric guitar will result in a sustained, rasp, growling
		sound that makes your heart jump in wild emotion. Rock and Roll!</p>

	<p>
		If you pluck more strings, you get into trouble, though. The more
		harmonics you add -and the more distortion you set- the more a
		harmonic mess your sound will be. When playing chords in an electric
		guitar you need to make a compromise: if you want complex harmonies
		you need to keep you amp gain low. If you want heavy distortion you
		need to keep chords to its bare minimum; that's why <em><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_chord">power chords</a></em>
		where devised: simple two- o three-note chords that will sound neat
		and punchy under distortion.
	</p>

	<p>As a conclussion, it must be emphasized that the main aspect
		governing amp distortion (apart from the amp gain) is input level. Low
		input levels will go neutral through your amp, only high-enough levels
		will push it into saturation. Between your guitar and your amp, a lot
		of things may modify your signal level, starting by the guitar and the
		player themselves: some guitars are "hotter" than others (see pickup
		sections below) and you may pluck the string softly or heavily.</p>

	<p>Every effect pedal and effect processor is a point where signal
		level may change. Amplification-based (distortion) pedals and
		boosters, by definition, affect your signal level. You don't only need
		to care about the signal level fed into the amp but also the level
		that every pedal feeds into the next one. Of course every pedal has an
		output volume knob for that.</p>

	<p>Time-based effects (phasers, choruses, flangers, delays) are
		specially tricky, as their output level will usually oscillate.
		Chances there are that the output signal from those saturate your amp
		only at periodic -or worse, erratic- peaks, leading your amp to a
		pulsating or unpredictable distortion.</p> <a id="section5"
	name="section5"></a>
	<h2>5. Amp stages</h2>

	<p>In primitive amps distortion was deemed a deffect or limitation.
		The idea was to amplify the signal with high-fidelity, but with the
		technology then available some distortion couldn't be avoided when the
		amp was taken near its maximum volume.</p>

	<p>Anyway, those first electric guitar players soon appreciated the
		benefits of distortion, and it became a prominent feature in Rock
		music. But then a problem showed up: in order to have distortion the
		amp needed to be cranked up, which could or couldn't be appropiate for
		certain gigs: given the required volume for the room size, a low power
		amp could give too much distortion and a high power one maybe too
		little.</p>

	<p>
		That difficulty was overcame by building amps in two stages called <em>preamp</em>
		and <em>power stage</em>. In theory, the preamp is where the
		distortion is set, usually by a knob labelled <em>gain</em>. After
		that, the power stage sets the required ouput volume by a <em>master</em>
		knob and usually has a builtin equalizer to tweak your tone. The
		two-stage design has an additional benefit: some effect pedals and
		processors that are more suitable to be applied after the signal
		distortion can be inserted between both stages; amps usually have send
		/ return jacks for that. Amps also usually feature several <em>channels</em>;
		that's simply different preamps with different amounts of distortion,
		suitable for different styles of music as well as to change dynamics
		within a piece (for example, between rythm and solo work). Most amps
		are built this way nowadays.
	</p>

	<p>Anyway, in an all-tube amp, the power stage can distort too! And
		some players favour its usually harsh distortion over the creamier one
		produced by the preamp tubes. So, back to the beginning: the desired
		distortion amount and quality doesn't always relate well to the
		required output level. First consideration when buying an amp,
		therefore, is the required power for the player needs. Some modern
		amps feature selectable output level for the power stage; that is a
		wonderful idea.</p> <a id="section6" name="section6"></a>
	<h2>6. Playing at high volume &rarr; Feedback!</h2>

	<p>Well, you have your string vibration transformed into an
		electric wave, sent to the amp, amplified and cast into the air by the
		loudspeaker. The pressure waves (that's what sound is) will get back
		to the string; when playing at high volume, chances there are that
		they push the string into vibration again, thus reinforcing the
		electric wave sent to the amp, pushing further the string and so on.
		You've hit a feedback loop!</p>

	<p>If distortion makes your guitar get sustain, feedback can make
		for a lot more of it. Actually, given the right conditions, feedback
		can make your guitar sustain forever (while your amp keeps working,
		duh). Feedback also reinforces your input signal to the amp, pushing
		it further into saturation, thus enriching your tone.</p>

	<p>
		The beautiful thing about feedback is its live, organic, wild nature.
		For it to work, the right harmonic need to reach the string <em>in
			phase</em>, and that's not easy. Sound waves are reflected on walls and
		other objects; a certain harmonic may be filtered out by the
		reflecting surface material, and those which make up to the string
		will hit it in or out of phase depending on the overall round trip
		distance from the loudspeaker to the reflecting surface and back to
		the string. Hence, feedback is really sensitive to the environment,
		amp equalization, body position and even room temperature. Controlling
		it is part of the playing technique of an electric guitar player.
	</p>

	<p>Sure, you crank up your amp master volume knob and eventually
		any string will get into feedback, but it's a miracle it'll have any
		musical value. For it to add up to your music you need to get the
		right harmonic in the right amount at the precise moment you need it.
		That's tough to master.</p>

	<p>In any case you need to play your guitar LOUD. Not as loud as to
		make your head explode or push your amp into an uncontrollable mess,
		but in the right amount to achieve some tone-improving feedback. It's
		a shame that's usually above the tolerable volume level for your home.
		If you're wondering whether your amp isn't worth the lot of money you
		paid for it, maybe you just need to crank it up a little bit. Get a
		rehearsal room. Use taste.</p> <a id="section7" name="section7"></a>
	<h2>7. Pickups</h2>

	<p>Pickups, you know, are those little devices below the strings
		where the electromagnetic induction thing happens.</p>

	<p>First thing to know is that there're two fundamental ways to
		build a pickup: with a single coil or with two reversely-magnetized
		coils.</p>

	<p>
		Single-coil pickup are the simplest and oldest ones. They provide a
		clean, harmonic-rich, bell-like sound, somehow similar to that of an
		acoustic guitar. They have a problem, too: they're very prone to pick
		up enviromental electromagnetic radiation (tipically from electric
		apparels nearby) causing an audible <em>hum</em> in your amp that gets
		to be very annoying at high gains and high volumes.
	</p>

	<p>
		That's precisely what two-reversely-magnetized-coils pickups where
		designed for, and that's why they were given the catchier denomination
		of <em>humbuckers</em>. These pickups effectively cancel
		environment-inducted hum, but at the cost of a poorer tone: darker,
		heavier, with less harmonics.
	</p>

	<p>Both types are in use nowadays, and are usually devoted to
		different kinds of music. Single-coils are appropiate for light,
		low-distortion sounds, where hum isn't much of a problem and harmonic
		spectrum isn't too much adulterated. Humbuckers, on the other side,
		perform better with high distortion because their narrower spectrum
		prevents the messy harmonic interference to some extent. Also because
		a pair of coils give a higher signal that pushes your amp into
		saturation more readily.</p>

	<p>
		Electric guitars usually have two or three pickups in different
		positions usually identified as: neck, middle (when there's one) and
		bridge pickup. The main difference between them is that they <em>see</em>
		the string differently. The neck pickup is near (or at) the center of
		the string, therefore it picks up the first (fundamental) harmonic at
		its maximum amplitude; bridge pickup, on the other side gets very
		little of that and so its sound is relatively poor in low harmonics.
	</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<canvas id="chart-pickup-placement"></canvas>
	</div>

	<p>As a result, the neck pickup yields a mellow, complex sound
		while that of the bridge pickup is brighter and more articulate.
		Usually the first is preferred for rythm work and the later for
		soloing, but of course anyone can use them at will.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not forgetting about the middle pickup: it just has an
		intermediate character between the two others, so no much to say about
		it. Usually a certain guitar will feature all single-coils <em>or</em>
		all humbuckers, although mixed sets aren't uncommon-
	</p>
	<p>The switch for pickup selection will usually allow to choose
		between the two or three available and several combinations of them:
	<ul>
		<li>In a two-pickup guitar a three-way switch allows for neck,
			neck+bridge or bridge pickup operation.</li>
		<br />
		<li>In a three-pickup guitar a five-way switch allows for neck,
			neck+middle, middle, middle+bridge or bridge pickup operation.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>You may guess that combining two pickups will yield a sound
		that's a mix of both. You're right, but there're still some
		considerations:
	<ul>
		<li>There're two essential ways of combining two pickups: in
			series or in parallel. The later is the preferred method for a simple
			reason: in-series pickups double the signal, so changing from single
			to combined pickups would require adjusting your volume knob to keep
			a consistent signal level; that's difficult to manage while playing.
			But</li>
		<br />
		<li>When connecting pickups in series and anti-phase an
			interesting effect shows up. Two adjacents pickups will see pretty
			much the same fundamental but different amounts of higher armonics.
			Thus, in anti-phase the fundamental is mostly cancelled out, leaving
			only higher harmonics and resulting in a harsh, bright sound.
			Generally speaking, this feature is only found in custom guitars
			specially tailored for a player's needs; those may also include an
			in-phase / anti-phase switch to select the mode of operation
			(although in-series and in-phase pickup pairs are difficult to
			handle, as said before).</li>
		<br />
		<li>In guitars equipped with single-coil pickups, they're usually
			installed with their magnets alternated. That way, when you combine
			two adjacent pickups they will benefit from some humbucking effect.
			For the hum-canceling part, at least: real humbuckers usually have
			their coils connected in series, thus yielding a higher level signal
			too.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Another interesting tweak is having <em>coil-splittable</em>
			humbuckers: specially wired humbuckers allowing for switcheable
			single / dual coil operation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p> <a id="section8" name="section8"></a>
	<h2>8. Equalization</h2>
	<p>As said before, mostly every amp has a builtin equalizer (eq for
		short) that serves a few different purposes. They're usually two-
		(bass, treble) or three-band (bass, mid, treble); if in need of a
		finer tweaking you can always insert an external multi-band eq betwen
		the preamp and the power stage. If you're really picky, another eq can
		be inserted before the preamp to tweak the signal you feed into it.</p>

	<p>
		You may guess what's the main purpose of a guitar amp eq: setting your
		overall tone to <em>cut through</em> the band mix. The natural place
		for the guitar within a band is in the mids, so you'll usually set a
		lot of mid and relatively low bass and treble. The exactly opposite
		equalization isn't uncommon, though: high bass, high treble and low
		mid: along with heavy distortion, this "scoop eq" yields a dark, heavy
		sound with rasp highs, usually found in some metal styles. It can also
		be nice when you play by yourself, as it makes your guitar sound <em>wider</em>
		and fill the space.
	</p>

	<p>
		Having a builtin eq in the amp is truly a need because, you know, your
		gain setting alters your tone <em>a lot</em>. Adding gain results in a
		darker tone with somehow aggresive highs that you'll need to trim to
		your band mix. That's why a good amp won't have just one but a
		dedicated eq for every preamp channel.
	</p>

	<p>The eq is also important to favour feedback where you want it to
		be (tonally speaking) and restraining your pickup hum, if it's there.</p>

	<p>Of course you can't always have all that said above, so
		equalization is usually a matter of compromise. Tweak it to taste.</p>

	<p>
		A more general use for the eq, not only related to guitar amps but to
		every sound system, is profiling your sound to compensate for room
		behaviour. A certain wave going off the speaker will expand to every
		surface in the room; depending on the wave frequency and the surface
		material, it may rebound cleanly, damped or either be absorbed. Thus
		the wave will reach your ear directly from the speaker <em>and</em>
		rebounded from surfaces nearby <em>in different amplitude and
			phases</em>, which may therefore add or substract. As a result, the room
		you're in, and your position within it, will favour some frequencies
		and damage others, severly affecting the sound spectrum. That's the
		main reason why every decent sound system needs an eq.
	</p>

	<p>If you're playing by yourself at home, you can tweak your amp
		for that, but playing for an audience is a fully different matter: you
		can set a sound that makes you happy in your playing position, but
		everybody else in the room will pick a different one. That's why
		achieving a good live sound is so hard (and in certain rooms not even
		possible). In big gigs, the sound coming off the amp is mic'ed (picked
		up by a microphone) and sent to a PA, where a sound technician can
		work out a good overall mix. The mic is usually placed very
		close to the amp speaker, almost touching the cover grid, in order to
		get only the sound coming directly off it, and in an very specific
		position relative to the speaker cone.</p> <a id="section9"

	<h2>Epilogue: words from wise men</h2>

	<p>
		You should totally check <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkhmDEKeaBU&t=675s">this
			video</a> from Brian May. Don't let the title mislead you: the most
		interesting part of it is the first ten minutes, when Brian talks
		about his gear and how he uses it. Maybe you've heard before about his
		Red Special guitar, built by his father and himself when he was a
		teenager, featuring some interesting devices as switches to turn
		pickups off and on, either in phase or anti-phase. It's also
		interesting to learn how, when using time-based effects, he split his
		signal and routes it into different amps to avoid erratic input
		buildup that would lead to messy, non-stable distortion. No wonder he
		ends up using fourteen (fourteen!) Vox AC-30 amps for live gigs!
	</p>

	<p>
		I also encourage you to watch <a
			href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229360/"> It Might Get Loud</a>,
		a documentary about the electric guitar by Davis Guggenheim with Jack
		White, Jimmy Page and The Edge. It focus on the music and the mystic
		of Rock and Roll rather than in technical details like those discussed
		here, but it's a very enjoyable film anyway.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, I have to recommend <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zivSIK0ulalOOYMXCiRlw">Thomas
			Schuber's Youtube Channel</a>. He tests guitar related gear, and he knows
		so much about guitars and is such a good communicator that you can
		learn a whole lotta things with his videos. He's a fine player too. I
		bougth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2GzSd6oVnc">my
			amp</a> because of him.
