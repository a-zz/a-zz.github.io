<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
	I'm afraid I must start talking about myself. I'm kind of an all-purpose IT 
	engineer doing anything from system management, technology consultancy, 
	software development to even (seldom) help desk. I don't complaint, my wage 
	is nice.
</p>
<p>
	When out of office, I have other interests like watercolor painting, 
	photography, music, mountain hiking, scientific culture, bla, bla, and 
	usually find myself willing to write about any of those. I've tried 
	blogging on WordPress, but soon got bored about it. 
</p>
<p>
	Several days ago, while googling for some tech-related stuff I found a 
	guy stating, as a side note, that <em>GitHub Pages is the only blogging 
	platform I feel comfortable with</em>. That far, I had downloaded software 
	from GitHub often but knew very little about it. Learning is fun, so I 
	started looking out about Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages and... "blogging 
	platform", you say? Really? GitHub Pages is just a static web server; its  
	only special feature is that it's backed by Git as a versioning system. As a 
	long time developer and long time Subversion user, I feel at ease with 
	versioning systems; I find them very convenient and great for peace-of-mind 
	when working on any project involving files (i.e. <em>any project</em>), not 
	only software-related. So... I had no idea about what I was actually 
	looking for, but the whole thing had a nice aroma.

<p>
	Editing raw HTML is fine to me, but keeping a site just by writing and 
	linking HTML pages -and keeping it <em>coherently</em>- is a pain. I'd like
	a content management system (CMS) that would keep track of content files and
	render them in a seamless fashion, while keeping a lot of flexibility for 
	doing... anything I'd eventually like. I guess such a solution should exist
	somewhere, but using a server-side CMS is out of the question as GitHub 
	pages has no server-side processing capabilities. So... could a client-side 
	(JavaScript based) CMS be feasible?
</p>
<p>
	So I started this project early this morning and I'm committing the project 
	layout and basic functionality by lunch time (spanish lunch time, must be
	noted). Current status is just <em>proof-of-concept</em>, but I really 
	like where this is heading so far. My boss may not be happy about my 
	performance today, but hey: it's research!    
</p>
<p>
	PS. GitHub Pages rules!<br/>
	PS(2). Sure, there's <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but 
	building my own CMS instead of using a third-party one is the whole point of
	this site!
