	<h1>About this site</h1>
	<p>
		I'm afraid I must start talking about myself. I'm kind of an all-purpose IT engineer doing anything
		from system management, technology consultancy, software development
		to even (seldom) help desk. I don't complaint, my wage is nice.
	</p>
	<p>When out of office, I have other interests like watercolor
		painting, photography, music, mountain hiking, scientific culture,
		bla, bla, and usually find myself willing to write about any of those.
		I've tried blogging on WordPress, but soon got bored about it.</p>
	<p>
		Several days ago, while googling for some tech-related stuff I found a
		guy stating, as a side note, that <em>GitHub Pages is the only
			blogging platform I feel comfortable with</em>. That far, I had downloaded
		software from GitHub often but knew very little about it. Learning is
		fun, so I started looking out about Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages and...
		"blogging platform", you say? Really? GitHub Pages is just a static
		web server; its only special feature is that it's backed by Git as a
		versioning system. As a long time developer and long time Subversion
		user, I feel at ease with versioning systems; I find them very
		convenient and great for peace-of-mind when working on any project
		involving files (i.e. <em>any project</em>), not only
		software-related. So... I had no idea about what I was actually
		looking for, but the whole thing had a nice aroma.
	</p>
	<p>
		Editing raw HTML is fine to me, but keeping a site just by writing and
		linking HTML pages -and keeping it <em>coherently</em>- is a pain. I'd
		like a content management system (CMS) that would keep track of
		content files and render them in a seamless fashion, while keeping a
		lot of flexibility for doing... anything I'd eventually like. I guess
		such a solution should exist somewhere, but using a server-side CMS is
		out of the question as GitHub pages has no server-side processing
		capabilities. So... could a client-side (JavaScript based) CMS be
		feasible?
	</p>
	<p>
		So I started <a href="https://github.com/a-zz/a-zz.github.io">this
			project</a> early this morning and I'm committing the project layout and
		basic functionality by lunch time (spanish lunch time, must be noted).
		Current status is just <em>proof-of-concept</em>, but I really like
		where this is heading so far. My boss may not be happy about my
		performance today, but hey: it's research!

		PS. GitHub Pages rules!<br /><br/> PS(2). Sure, there's <a
			href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but building
		my own CMS instead of using a third-party one is the whole point of
		this site!<br /><br/> PS(3). As of 2017-06-26 the CMS is oficially named <strong>brⱯvⱯs</strong>.
		Sure, weird name: it attempts to be a visual joke with <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patatas_bravas">
			patatas bravas</a> and the mathematical symbol <em>for all</em>. Using
		Unicode characters in code guarantees cross-compatibility issues and
		unexpected problems, so for internal use project name is <em>bravas</em>.
		<br/><br/>
		PS(4). I'm using this site as a web technology sandbox, so some things may fail on 
		certain browsers. My apologies!
        <br/><br/>
		PS(5). As of 2019-04-27, <strong>brⱯvⱯs</strong> is a <a href="index.html?bravas">project on its own</a>. Maybe it can be useful to anyone else.
